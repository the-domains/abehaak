**Hanlon Mountain in Mist**

Ril Sams came by, but now the house is still

and cold with dread. Unless this weather breaks,

I look for another grave on Newfound Hill.

Rain rumbles on the roof, splashes from the eaves,

and foams and bubbles into tubs below

the spouts. The barn, the shingles on the crib

drip black with rain. Springhouse mosses grow

frog-green and Hanlon's top is lost in mist.

Ril Sams climbed Hanlon with his hounds last night,

but when they winded something below the top,

and wouldn't go beyond the lantern light,

and trembled o the lead, then he came home.

I trust the hounds: they know what made them stop,

what waits there in the mist on Hanlon's top.
